# DAO Package
The DAO package contains Data Access Objects.
These Data Access Objects interact with the database.
We could have an actual database such as MySQL, or we could have an in-memory database which is just a collection of buyers, sellers, and items.
We will create a common interface and then implement different DAO classes to interact with different kinds of databases.
